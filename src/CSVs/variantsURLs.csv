"Fire Pea","The Fire Pea is a flaming sensation, able to withstand the heat of being permanently on fire. Fire Pea is very popular in winter and saves money on his heating bill.","The Fire Pea can be obtained from any sticker pack."
"Ice Pea","The Ice Pea is the coldest Peashooter around, but still carries a warm personality.","The Fire Pea can be obtained from any sticker pack."
"Toxic Pea","Toxic Pea deals toxic damage to Zombies just by standing near them!","However, try not to get too close to him, as this will poison you instantly."
"Commando Pea","His fully automatic, direct-damage style makes him stand out from the crowd.","It is wise to avoid long-range combat and instead get close before attacking. Never fight more than two zombies at a time unless you have a backup plan or you are receiving support from other plants. When playing this variant in Garden Warfare 2, it may be important to use the zoom upgrade, for the Commando Pea's close range weapon when facing an enemy from far away, though it may be not needed for the Hyper ability."
"Agent Pea","Licensed to Vanquish - the Agent Pea is a silent stalker, and makes vanquishing Zombies look easy. For king and country...and Crazy Dave.","While the Agent Pea is capable of dealing damage at such a high rate that he practically vanquishes weaker zombies almost outright, he possesses the lowest health out of all Peashooters, at just 100 HP. This makes him very vulnerable to ambushes and surprise attacks. With this in mind, always be aware of your surroundings, do not let the zombies catch you by surprise, for if they do, they can vanquish you before you even gain a chance to react, so be cautious when you play."
"Law Pea","Wherever there is injustice, you will find him. Wherever there is suffering, he'll be there! Wherever liberty is threatened, you will find... the Law Pea! Only available from 9am to 6pm, Monday to Thursday and also not available on Holidays.","Law Pea can be very useful in Team Vanquish and Vanquish Confirmed! as his fire rate is enough to kill a zombie with six shots (except All-Stars)."
"Plasma Pea","The Plasma Peashooter shoots peas. Peas that are entire universes unto themselves. Peas of swirling, twirling galaxies, home to millions of stars, Peas with enormous nebulae that dwarf you and I, Peas sewn of the very fabric of space time, from which the infinite possibilities of the cosmos are born.","Peas that exist in a wave of probability help you reload faster."
"Rock Pea","Rock Pea's added bulk results in added health, and slightly reduced movement speed.",""
"Electro Pea","Push the fire button while shots are airborne to trigger an extra large electric explosion!","As always, the combination of upgrades depends on how you play. If these upgrades don't work for you, try different combinations."

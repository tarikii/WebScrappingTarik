"Peashooter","Peashooter is always in the front line fight against any Zombie invasion. He likes to play things fast, loose, and frantic adopting more of a run and gun mentality. When he sneezes he's a danger to both himself and others around him.","Perhaps his biggest gift is his splash damage, something very few plant classes have. This allows the Peashooter to effectively combat against groups of zombies. He also has a decent fire rate to help. His reloading time is also very fast, which makes him a good front-line assaulter. To further compliment this, his Chili Bean Bomb is very effective at catching players off-guard due to its radius and rather short fuse. This, combined with the Hyper ability makes him a dangerous attacker; while being already difficult to hit with the increased speed, the Peashooter can jump around and attack, taking advantage of the splash damage, making him near impossible to shoot down, while gradually draining his opponent's health, forcing them to either attempt to shoot at him, which is very hard to do, or retreat."
"Sunflower","The Sunflower is the backbone of the Plant army and keeps her teammates in the fight with her superior healing and sunny personality. She prefers to stay near the back of the fight, lending assistance with her long range attacks.","You are in a 2v1 against a Sunflower and a Chomper. You manage to vanquish the Chomper, but the Sunflower finishes you off. She then proceeds to revive the Chomper you just vanquished."
"Chomper","The Chomper primarily uses hit and run tactics to get in close and feast on Zombies. He prefers tunneling underground and emerging beneath Zombies for surprise attacks. He loves the taste of Zombie feet - with just a dash of salt.","Perhaps the most difficult match-up is against the Engineer; as the Concrete Launcher is stronger than the Chomp from the front, the Sonic Grenade can force you overground, and Engineers riding Jackhammers are in particularly hard to vanquish; because any attempt to eat them will only destroy the Jackhammers, leaving the Chomper in his vulnerable eating state. However, Chompers can Goop or snare them to make an easy chomp."
"Cactus","The Cactus is the long-range specialist of the Plant team, able to shoot high velocity needles at faraway Zombies. In her rooted form, she can dispatch her flying Garlic Drone to call in Corn Artillery strikes from above.","Mines and battlements could also be used as a last resort when under attack by a Zombie. Backing up while placing walls and mines can block off the attacking zombie, allowing you to escape or use the created gap to vanquish them."
"Citron","Use his ball form to roll right into the action before switching to attack mode, laying waste to Zombies with his Orange Beam!","Mines and battlements could also be used as a last resort when under attack by a Zombie. Backing up while placing walls and mines can block off the attacking zombie, allowing you to escape or use the created gap to vanquish them."
"Rose","Her homing Magic Thistles, Zombie-halting Time Snare and mystifying Goatify ability make Rose a tricky threat!","Rose becomes especially dangerous at longer ranges (but still within her lock-on range) where her projectiles, due to the fact that they lock on and home in on their target, become nigh-impossible to avoid without cover, allowing her to deal a lot of damage to a given target."
"Kernel Corn","Kernel Corn was stationed overseas for the events of the first Garden Warfare. Hearing about the conflict at home, he returned to a Suburbia transformed. Now he's ready to lead the Plants to victory, and tacos, but mostly victory."," "
"Torchwood","Legend has it Torchwood was locked away in a magic chest because of his immeasurable rage. Waiting in that chest's purgatory his rage only continued to grow and multiply. Now he is released and searching for vengeance.","Try not to stray too far from other plants as Torchwood is very weak on his own. Hanging around Sunflowers is a good idea, as they can keep you alive."
